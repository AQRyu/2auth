# Security Fix: Self-Deletion Prevention

## Problem

The authentication system originally allowed logged-in admin users to delete themselves, which is a security vulnerability that could lead to:

1. **Admin lockout**: If the last admin deletes themselves, the system could be left without any administrative access
2. **Accidental self-deletion**: Users might accidentally delete their own accounts
3. **Poor user experience**: Self-deletion can cause confusion and authentication issues

## Solution

### Backend Changes

1. **Modified AdminController.deleteUser()** (`/backend/src/main/java/com/aqryuz/auth/controller/AdminController.java`):
   - Added `Authentication` parameter to access current user context
   - Added self-deletion prevention logic that compares current user with target user
   - Returns `400 Bad Request` if user attempts to delete themselves
   - Added proper import for `Authentication` interface

2. **Frontend Enhancement** (`/backend/src/main/resources/static/admin-dashboard.js`):
   - Enhanced error handling to detect self-deletion attempts (HTTP 400)
   - Provides clear error message: "Cannot delete your own account. Please ask another admin to delete your account if needed."

### Test Coverage

Created comprehensive tests (`/backend/src/test/java/com/aqryuz/auth/integration/AdminSelfDeletionTest.java`):

1. **shouldPreventAdminSelfDeletion()**: Verifies that self-deletion returns 400 Bad Request
2. **shouldAllowAdminToDeleteOtherUsers()**: Ensures admins can still delete other users normally

## Implementation Details

### Backend Logic

```java
// Prevent self-deletion
String currentUsername = authentication.getName();
UserInfo userToDelete = userService.getUserById(id);

if (currentUsername.equals(userToDelete.getUsername())) {
    log.warn("Admin {} attempted to delete themselves", currentUsername);
    return ResponseEntity.badRequest().build();
}
```

### Frontend Error Handling

```javascript
if (response.status === 400) {
    alert('Cannot delete your own account. Please ask another admin to delete your account if needed.');
}
```

## Security Benefits

1. **Prevents admin lockout scenarios**
2. **Maintains system administrative access**
3. **Provides clear user feedback**
4. **Logs security-relevant attempts**
5. **Maintains functionality for legitimate use cases**

## Testing

All tests pass including:

- New self-deletion prevention tests
- Existing authentication integration tests
- Full project compilation

The fix is minimal, focused, and maintains backward compatibility while enhancing security.
